## Updating

Instructions on this process in video linked above; [skip to the thirty nine minute mark.](https://youtu.be/YM7wYx_SsRY&t=2341)

To update: 
* On your Windows or mac PC, download the firmware "update.bin" file from this repository or funnyplaying's google drive links
* Firmware update **must** be named "update.bin". You cannot rename after copying.
* Switch FPGA GBC on with no game inserted
* Plug console into PC via USB Type C data cable (USB 2.0 is fine but USB 3.0 or USB Type C host type cables should also work)
* Copy "update.bin" file over to 1MB "FUNNY_PLAY_" file system
* Device will begin the update immediately while file copies
* Once copy is completed and device reboots, the update is completed

Occasionally, the saved display profile is corrupt and the console will display a garbled screen image on boot after updating to a different firmware version. 

To fix this, you need to blindly modify the settings. Try the following keypresses to save defaults and reset the console -- display should be usable from there. This is known to occur for users updating from 0.90 to 1.02 on v1.1 hardware and from 0928 or earlier builds to 1005 and later builds on v1.0 hardware.

Note that [debouncing](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/debouncing) does not appear to be implemented for OSD controls in some firmware versions so this may take several attempts. Without debouncing, one button press could be interpreted as two or more by the system. Try power cycling the console between attempts to reset to a known state.
